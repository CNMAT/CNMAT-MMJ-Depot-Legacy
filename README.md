CNMAT-MMJ-Depot
===============

CNMAT's expanding collection of Max/MSP/Jitter patches designed for composers, programmers, performers and music educators. The MMJ-Depot, although not exclusively written in Max/MSP/Jitter format (.maxpat and .maxhelp), is meant to be loaded into and used with the languate.  The MMJ-Depot includes basic programming tips, modular programming units for copy and paste, interactive tutorials on all aspects of computer music, and functioning musical works with commentary and criticism.
